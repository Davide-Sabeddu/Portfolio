Hi! I am Davide Sabeddu, class 95 and born in Italy. I am a critical thinker and problem-solver with a strong aptitude in machine learning, neuroscience, and physics. Iâ€™m always ready to roll up my sleeves and tackle challenges head-on to get the job done.. I am currently studying as a PhD student in Electrical Engineering. My research interest is the use of amplitude mode ultrasound transducers to capture forearm muscle activity and predict multiple hand gestures with unsupervised learning. 
Here my Python projects I completed during my program in Data Science and Machine Learning [2023] and my MATLAB code I wrote for my Master's thesis and internship [2022].
