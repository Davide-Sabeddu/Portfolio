Hi! I am Davide Sabeddu, class 95 and born in Italy. During my studies I have developed a mindset for critical thinking, problem-solving and quick adaptability to new technologies and approaches from different disciplines. I am currently working as a functional analyst for the local government of my home island. Nevertheless, I am looking for
opportunities as research assistant and PhD vacancies with a keen interest in the field of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) /
neuroprostetics and ultrasonic stimulation. Here my Python projects I completed during my program in Data Science and Machine Learning [2023] and my MATLAB code I wrote for my Master's thesis and internship [2022].
