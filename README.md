Hi! Thank you for visiting my page!

I’m **Davide Sabeddu**, born in 1995 and originally from Italy.  
I’m a critical thinker and problem-solver with a strong background in **neuroscience, and physics**. I bring energy, curiosity and persistence to every challenge, and I don’t rest until I’ve figured it out.  

I'm eager to begin my career in an environment where constant growth and effective contribution go hand in hand. I'm drawn to high-performance teams with a focus on mentorship and collaboration, where I can learn from seasoned employees while contributing in terms of new ideas on modern issues.

What drives me the most is finding solutions to interdisciplinary problems that have a tangible impact on people. I thrive in team settings with emotionally intelligent teammates who understand the greatest outcomes result from different minds contributing their effort to a common mission of service.

Rather than confining myself to a specialized area in the beginning of my career, I'm excited to learn how different fields come together and complement each other in solving problems that are multilateral in nature. I'm looking for a role where one grows by being exposed to myriad challenges and where the collective wisdom of the group sharpens everybody's capability.

If you’re looking for someone who’s motivated, coachable, technically solid and not afraid of challenges, let’s connect!
